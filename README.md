# Neural-Networks-for-Survival-Data
Neural networks are a form of artificial intelligence that have found application in a wide range  of problems. These systems are presented as a stimulus, a set of input variables, and produce in response ,  a prediction as to the class or probability of an event associated with that stimulus. Neural networks have  been used with comparable and, in some cases, superior results to standard mechanistic or statistical  models. The semi – parametric Cox proportional hazards regression is the most widely used method for  analyzing survival data. It studies the effects of the covariate variables on survival by estimating hazard  functions. In this study, understanding the epidemiology of reported COVID – 19 cases helps decision  makers in planning future responses
There has been increasing interest in modeling survival data using deep learning methods in 
medical research. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how a form of neural network analysis can
be used to perform survival analysis on survival data, and to compare neural network analysis with the 
most commonly used technique for this type of analysis, Cox regression. This study predicts the factors 
which are highly affected on the survival of corona patients using survival models and neural networks. 
This study forecasts the count of number of patients in next 10 days using LSTM model. It is very helpful 
to decision makers in planning future responses. The data obtained from the Indian Statistical Institute , 
Bangalore center. In Karnataka state, first COVID-19 case was detected on March 09, 2020.
Methods: 
We analyzed state’s COVID – 19 data from March 09, 2020 to July 21, 2020 to describe 
patient’s distribution. We analyzed the data in such a way that, it helps to find out the factors which are 
mostly affects on survival of CORONA patients in Karnataka state
